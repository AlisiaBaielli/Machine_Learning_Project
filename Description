DESCRIPTON
----------

This dataset is composed of 1300 samples with 35 features each. The first column
is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 2 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features.

Your task is the following: you should compare the performance of a Support-
Vector Machine (implemented by sklearn.svm.LinearSVC) with that of a Random
Forest (implemented by sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier). Try to optimize
both algorithms' parameters and determine which one is best for this dataset. At
the end of the analysis, you should have chosen an algorithm and its optimal set
of parameters: write this choice explicitly in the conclusions of your notebook.
